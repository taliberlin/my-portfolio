        Obtaining a bachelor's degree in Arts, International Relations (with
        distinction) from the University of British Columbia was a gratifying
        journey, but unfulfilling in terms of passion. My heart was called to
        the film industry, so I pursued that with full force. Quickly, I
        realized that while this new journey was satisying my creative desires,
        I was left craving more. I wanted to utilize the full scope of my
        interests and abilities, and I wanted to keep learning. That's where
        software development came in. I happened upon an online coding workshop
        and decided to give it a try. To my surprise, I was able to not only
        make use of both my logic and creativity (through problem-solving), but
        I also enjoyed the process itself! Now I take great pleasure in figuring
        out the most efficient way to develop responsive web applications. Check
        out my projects, let's get in touch!
