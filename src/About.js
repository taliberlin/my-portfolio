            Obtaining a bachelor's degree in International Relations from the
            University of British Columbia was a gratifying achievement, but
            unfulfilling. My heart was called to the film industry, so I pursued
            that with full force. Quickly, I realized that while this new
            journey was satisying my creative desires, I was left craving more.
            Although I still love creating for TV/film, I wanted to utilize the
            full scope of my interests and abilities, and I wanted to keep
            learning. That's where software development came in. I happened upon
            an online coding workshop and decided to give it a try. To my
            surprise, I found that software development allowed me to channel
            both my logical thinking and my creative flair, as I delved into the
            art of problem-solving. Now, I take great pleasure in figuring out
            the most efficient way to develop responsive web applications using
            VS Code, React.js and Bootstrap. Check out my projects, let's get in
